# Craftile Editor

A modern, extensible block-based page editor built with TypeScript and Vue 3.
Designed for building **block-driven systems** like Shopifyâ€™s Theme Customizer, with first-class support for both **server-rendered** and **client-side rendered** blocks.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **ðŸ§± Block-based Architecture**
  Compose pages from reusable, configurable blocks that can be rendered on the server or the client.
- **âš¡ Real-time Preview**
  See changes instantly with a live preview iframe or inline rendering.
- **ðŸ”Œ Plugin System**
  Extend functionality with custom plugins and UI components.

## ðŸš€ Why Craftile?

Craftile is built for **structured content editing**.
Instead of embedding raw HTML, it outputs a **JSON block tree** that your application can render however you need:

- **Server-rendered**: Perfect for ecommerce platforms, CMS-driven pages, and theme customizers where templates are rendered by the backend.
- **Client-rendered**: Ideal for SPAs, dashboards, or applications where blocks render directly in the browser.

This flexibility makes it a strong foundation for:

- Theme customizers (Shopify-style block editors)
- CMS and page builders with server- or client-rendered layouts
- Apps that need structured, framework-agnostic block data
