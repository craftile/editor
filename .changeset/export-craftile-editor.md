feat(editor): export CraftileEditor class

Export the `CraftileEditor` class from the main package entry point, allowing users to import it directly for type annotations and advanced usage.

```typescript
// Now available
import { CraftileEditor } from '@craftile/editor';
import type { CraftileEditor } from '@craftile/editor';
```
