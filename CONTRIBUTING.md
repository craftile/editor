# Contributing to Craftile Editor

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Craftile Editor ðŸ’–, you're awesome!

There are many ways you can contribute to open source, and we value all of them. Here are some guidelines to help you prepare your contribution.

## Setup the Project

Follow these steps to get up and running with Craftile Editor development:

1. Fork the repository (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of [this page](https://github.com/craftile/editor))

2. Clone your fork locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/editor.git
cd editor
```

3. Install all dependencies and packages by running `pnpm install`. This will install dependencies and configure git hooks.

> If you encounter any issues during setup, please reach out to the Craftile team by opening an issue.

## Development

We've established tooling and systems to streamline our development process. Craftile Editor uses a monorepo architecture with the following structure:

### Directory Structure

| Package | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [core](packages/core) | Framework-agnostic block editor engine |
| [editor](packages/editor) | Vue.js-based editor UI components |
| [types](packages/types) | Shared TypeScript type definitions |
| [event-bus](packages/event-bus) | Generic event bus utility |
| [messenger](packages/messenger) | Type-safe window.postMessage wrapper |
| [preview-client](packages/preview-client) | Browser client for preview iframe functionality |
| [preview-client-html](packages/preview-client-html) | HTML preview client for static block rendering |
| [plugin-common-properties](plugins/common-properties) | Common block property fields |
| [plugin-static-blocks-renderer](plugins/static-blocks-renderer) | Static HTML block rendering plugin |

### Tooling

- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) for package and dependency management
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and building
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) for the editor UI
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for git hooks
- [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management and changelog generation

### Commands

**`pnpm install`**: sets up the entire project, creates symlinks between dependencies for cross-package development.

**`pnpm build`**: builds all packages and plugins.

**`pnpm build:packages`**: builds core packages only.

**`pnpm build:plugins`**: builds plugins only.

**`pnpm typecheck`**: runs TypeScript type checking across all packages.

**`pnpm format`**: formats code using Prettier.

**`pnpm format:check`**: verifies code formatting compliance.

**`pnpm test`**: runs tests for all packages (when available).

**`pnpm release`**: builds and publishes updated packages.

## Found a bug?

Please follow the issue template and provide a clear reproduction path with a code example. The most effective way to report a bug is by creating a minimal reproduction using a GitHub repo, CodeSandbox, or StackBlitz.

You can use our [playground](playground/) to help reproduce and demonstrate issues.

## Have an API proposal?

Please provide thoughtful comments and sample API code. Proposals that don't align with our roadmap or lack detailed explanations will be closed.

## Submitting a Pull Request?

Pull requests require approval from two or more collaborators to be merged; if the PR author is a collaborator, that counts as one approval.

### Commit Convention

Before creating a Pull Request, please ensure your commits follow the commit conventions used in this repository.

We ask that you follow the convention `category(scope or module): message` in your commit messages using one of these categories:

- `feat / feature`: introduces completely new code or features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (reference an issue when applicable)
- `refactor`: code-related changes that are neither fixes nor features
- `docs`: documentation changes (README, usage docs, etc.)
- `build`: build-related changes, dependency updates, or new dependencies
- `test`: test-related changes (adding or modifying tests)
- `ci`: continuous integration configuration changes (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- `chore`: repository changes that don't fit other categories

For detailed specifications, visit https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ or check the [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

### Pull Request Steps

1. Fork the craftile/editor repository and clone your fork

2. Create a new branch from the `main` branch following the convention `[type/scope]`. Examples: `fix/keyboard-shortcuts` or `docs/readme-update`. The `type` should be a conventional commit type, and `scope` is a brief description of the work area.

3. Make and commit your changes following the [commit convention](#commit-convention). Use `pnpm dev` to test changes in the playground and run `pnpm typecheck` to ensure no TypeScript errors.

4. Run `pnpm changeset` to create a detailed description of your changes for changelog generation. [Learn more about Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/tree/master/packages/cli).

5. When including code snippets in changesets, use proper syntax highlighting:

```typescript
// Example
const editor = createCraftileEditor({
  el: '#app',
  blockSchemas: [...]
})
```

> For minor changes like CI config or formatting, run `pnpm changeset add --empty` to create an empty changeset file.

### Testing

When possible, all bug fixes and new features should include tests. We're actively expanding our test coverage.
